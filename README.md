# PMLE
Python implementation of five classification algorithms using penalized maximum likelihood estimation
Used to obtain superior binary classifications with small, separated and imbalanced datasets

Firth's Logit - small datasets, separated datasets, imbalanced datasets 
Tuneable Firth - imbalanced datasets - binary classifications only
Firth's Logit with Intercept Correction (FLIC) - imbalanced datasets 
Firth's Logit with Added Covariate (FLAC) - imbalanced datasets 
Log-F(1,1) Logistic Regression - small datasets

*Data must be passed as pandas dataframes or series
